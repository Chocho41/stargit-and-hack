            <h2>What about me ?</h2>
            <h2>Why IronHack ?</h2>
            <p>During my business school curriculum, I did several intenships in Start-ups<br>
                around Growth and Marketing departments where I have been able to see code from closer than before.<br>
            I want to do Ironhack to combine my business school/Marketing skills to technicals skills in web dev and Javavscript.<br>
        This will allow me to be more independant and bettter at building landing pages, doing tracking, monitoring websites, building javascript scripts,<br>
    and bring the best of low-code tools with coding integration such as Zapier.</p>
